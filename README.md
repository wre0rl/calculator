## TODO
---
1. Let users input decimals, and make sure to not let them type more than one. e.g 12.5.6
2. Round the answer for decimals so they don't overflow the screen.
3. Make DEL button work.
4. Prevent users from clicking '=' before entering all of the numbers and operator.
5. Make the CSS pretty.
6. Add keyboard support.
